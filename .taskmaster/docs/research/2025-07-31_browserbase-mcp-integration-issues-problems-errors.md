# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Browserbase MCP integration issues problems errors troubleshooting

**Response:**

**Browserbase MCP integration** can present a range of issues during setup and operation, especially in complex agentic scraping pipelines like yours. Below is an exhaustive guide to troubleshooting and resolving common problems, tailored to your project’s architecture and workflows.

---

## 1. **Core Integration Architecture**

Your project uses a **BrowserbaseManager** for session orchestration, wraps Browserbase operations in CrewAI tools, and integrates vendor-specific agents (Tesco, Asda, Costco) for targeted scraping. The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server acts as the bridge between your LLM/agent layer and Browserbase’s cloud browser automation[3][2].

---

## 2. **Common Integration Issues and Troubleshooting**

### A. **Server Startup and Connectivity**

**Symptoms:**
- MCP server fails to start
- Agents/tools cannot connect to Browserbase
- Connection timeouts or refused connections

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- **Build and Dependency Check:** Ensure `pnpm build` (or `npm install` if using npm) completes without errors in the MCP server directory[1][3].
- **Port Conflicts:** Confirm the MCP server is running on the expected port (default: 3000) and that no firewall or process is blocking it[2].
- **API Key and Credentials:** Double-check that `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` (and optionally `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`) are set correctly in your `.env` or MCP config JSON[3][2].
- **Config File Location:** Ensure your configuration file is in the correct location (e.g., `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` or your project’s root)[2][3].
- **Restart Clients:** After config changes, always restart your LLM client or agent runner to reload the MCP server settings[1][4].

### B. **Authentication and Authorization Failures**

**Symptoms:**
- 401/403 errors from Browserbase API
- "Invalid API key" or "project not found" messages

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- **API Key Validity:** Confirm your API key is active and has not expired or been revoked[1][2][3].
- **Project ID:** If using project-scoped credentials, ensure `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` matches your Browserbase dashboard[3].
- **Environment Variables:** If running via CLI or subprocess, verify that environment variables are correctly passed to the MCP server process[3].

### C. **Action/Command Failures**

**Symptoms:**
- Navigation, click, or extraction commands fail or return errors
- Actions succeed in some sessions but not others

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- **Model Support:** Ensure your LLM or agent supports the required MCP actions (some models may not support advanced browser control)[1][3].
- **API Version Compatibility:** Check that your MCP server and Browserbase client libraries are compatible (update if needed)[3].
- **Command Syntax:** Validate the JSON payloads sent to the MCP server (malformed requests will be rejected)[2].
- **Session Health:** Use your `health_monitor.py` to check for zombie or stale sessions and trigger recovery logic if needed.

### D. **Network and Proxy Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Inconsistent connectivity
- Certain sites fail to load or are blocked

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- **Proxy Configuration:** If scraping sites with anti-bot measures, ensure proxies are configured in your Browserbase session options[1].
- **Stealth Mode:** Enable advanced stealth features if sites detect automation (Browserbase supports Puppeteer stealth plugins)[1].
- **Network Logs:** Inspect logs for network errors or DNS failures; adjust firewall or VPN settings as needed.

### E. **Session Pooling and Resource Limits**

**Symptoms:**
- "Session limit exceeded" errors
- Sessions not cleaned up, leading to resource exhaustion

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- **Session Pooling:** Review your `BrowserbaseManager` logic for session reuse and cleanup. Ensure `close()` or equivalent is called after each task.
- **Session Health Monitoring:** Use or extend `health_monitor.py` to detect and terminate orphaned sessions.
- **Concurrency Limits:** Check your Browserbase plan’s session/concurrency limits and adjust pool size accordingly.

### F. **Vendor-Specific Automation Failures**

**Symptoms:**
- Asda, Tesco, or Costco agents fail on navigation or extraction
- Selectors break after site updates

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- **Selector Robustness:** Regularly update selectors in `*_selectors.py` modules to match site changes.
- **Anti-Bot Detection:** Rotate user agents and enable stealth/proxy features for problematic vendors.
- **Error Logging:** Enhance logging in agent classes to capture full error traces and page snapshots for debugging.

---

## 3. **Advanced Debugging Techniques**

- **Verbose Logging:** Enable debug-level logging in `logging_config.py` for BrowserbaseManager and CrewAI tools to capture full request/response cycles.
- **Manual API Calls:** Use `curl` or Postman to manually test MCP endpoints (e.g., `/v1/browserbase/navigate`) to isolate issues outside your codebase[2].
- **Integration Tests:** Leverage and expand `tests/integration/test_browserbase_integration.py` to simulate real-world failures (e.g., invalid credentials, network drops).
- **Session Cleanup Scripts:** Use or schedule `scripts/cleanup_browserbase_sessions.py` to forcibly terminate stale sessions.

---

## 4. **Edge Cases and Pitfalls**

- **Model-Specific Arguments:** If using non-default LLMs, ensure `--modelName` and corresponding API keys are set in the MCP config[3].
- **Environment Mismatch:** Running the MCP server in a different environment (Docker, VM) may require explicit network and environment variable configuration.
- **API Rate Limits:** Browserbase may throttle requests if you exceed plan limits; implement exponential backoff and error handling in your session manager.

---

## 5. **Example: Minimal MCP Config for Local Development**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browserbase": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server-browserbase/cli.js"],
      "env": {
        "BROWSERBASE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID": "your_project_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Place this in your MCP config JSON and restart your agent runner[3].

---

## 6. **Actionable Recommendations for Your Project**

- **Automate Health Checks:** Integrate periodic health checks and auto-recovery in `health_monitor.py` for Browserbase sessions.
- **Centralize Error Reporting:** Aggregate errors from all agent and tool layers for unified troubleshooting.
- **Document Known Issues:** Maintain a living document of vendor-specific quirks and required Browserbase session options.
- **Continuous Integration:** Add CI jobs to run integration tests with mock and live Browserbase sessions to catch regressions early.

---

## 7. **References to Project Files**

- **`scraping_cli/browserbase_manager.py`**: Core session management and error handling logic.
- **`scraping_cli/browser_tools.py`**: CrewAI tool wrappers for Browserbase actions.
- **`scraping_cli/health_monitor.py`**: Session health and recovery.
