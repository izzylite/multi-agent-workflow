# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Browserbase MCP server Stagehand initialization error proxy target handler 2025 GitHub issues

**Response:**

The **"Stagehand initialization error: Cannot create proxy with a non-object as target or handler, and uninitialized page object"** is a known, open issue in the Browserbase MCP server (as of May 2025) and is directly relevant to your integration and tool development tasks[2]. This error typically arises during the initialization of the Stagehand component, which is responsible for managing browser automation sessions and proxying browser operations.

---

## 1. **Nature and Context of the Error**

- **Error Message:**  
  `"Cannot create proxy with a non-object as target or handler, and uninitialized page object"`[2].
- **Where It Occurs:**  
  During Stagehand initialization, often when attempting to create a proxy for a browser page or session object that is either `undefined`, `null`, or otherwise not a valid object.
- **Related Issues:**  
  - Issue #56 and #41 in the [browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase GitHub repository][2].
  - Similar errors reported in other MCP server contexts, such as "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pages')" and JSON parsing errors during startup[4].

---

## 2. **Technical Root Causes**

### a. **Proxy Target/Handler Must Be Objects**
- JavaScript's `Proxy` constructor requires both the target and handler to be non-null objects.
- If the code attempts to wrap an uninitialized or undefined page/session object, this error is thrown.

### b. **Uninitialized Page Object**
- The error often indicates that the browser page/session object has not been properly created or assigned before proxying.
- This can result from:
  - Asynchronous initialization not awaited (e.g., `await browser.newPage()` missing or failing).
  - Errors in upstream session creation logic (e.g., BrowserbaseManager or session pool returning `undefined`).
  - Misconfiguration in session options (e.g., invalid proxy settings, user agent, or vendor-specific parameters).

### c. **Configuration and Environment Issues**
- Misconfigured proxies or session parameters can cause the browser automation layer to fail to instantiate a valid page object.
- In cloud environments, network restrictions or sandboxing may prevent proper initialization, especially if local resources or callbacks are required[1].

## 3. **Relevant GitHub Issues and Community Reports**

| Issue # | Title/Description | Status | Key Details |
|---------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| #56     | Stagehand initialization error: Cannot create proxy with a non-object as target or handler, and uninitialized page object | Open   | Directly matches your error; no official fix as of May 2025[2]. |
| #41     | Failed to initialize Stagehand: Cannot create proxy with a non-object as target or handler | Open   | Similar error, possibly same root cause[2]. |
| #16     | Error in MCP connection to server stagehand: SyntaxError: Unexpected token ... / Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pages') | Open   | Indicates broader issues with Stagehand and session/page initialization[4]. |

---

## 4. **Implications for Your Project**

Given your use of **BrowserbaseManager** and session pooling, this error can manifest if:

- The session pool returns an uninitialized or failed session object.
- The wrapper methods for browser operations (navigation, extraction, etc.) attempt to interact with a page object that was never successfully created.
- Vendor-specific tools (e.g., TescoTool, AsdaVerifier) rely on a valid session/page object and encounter this error during their verification or scraping routines.

---

## 5. **Recommended Diagnostic and Mitigation Steps**

### a. **Session Initialization Checks**
- Ensure all session and page objects are fully initialized before proxying or exposing them to tools.
- Add explicit checks:
  ```python
  if page is None:
      raise RuntimeError("Browser page object not initialized")
  ```
- In JavaScript/TypeScript:
  ```js
  if (!page || typeof page !== 'object') {
      throw new Error("Page object is not initialized or not an object");
  }
  ```

### b. **Error Handling and Logging**
- Instrument the BrowserbaseManager and Stagehand initialization with detailed logging to capture:
  - Session creation failures
  - Proxy configuration errors
  - Asynchronous initialization timing issues

### c. **Session Pooling Robustness**
- When implementing session pooling, ensure that failed or uninitialized sessions are not returned to the pool or used by downstream tools.
- Add health checks before reusing pooled sessions.

### d. **Proxy and Configuration Validation**
- Validate all proxy and session configuration parameters before attempting to create sessions.
- Catch and log errors from invalid proxy settings, as these can cause silent failures upstream.

### e. **Integration Test Enhancements**
- Expand your integration tests to simulate and catch these initialization failures.
- Use mock sessions that deliberately fail to initialize to verify error handling pathways.

## 6. **Edge Cases and Pitfalls**

- **Race Conditions:**  
  If session creation is asynchronous and not properly awaited, tools may attempt to use a session before it is ready.
- **Vendor-Specific Logic:**  
  Vendor tools (Tesco, Asda, Costco) may have unique session requirements; ensure their initialization logic is robust against session failures.
- **Cloud vs. Local Differences:**  
  Some errors may only manifest in cloud environments due to network or sandboxing constraints (e.g., inability to launch a local web server for SSO flows)[1].

---

## 7. **Actionable Steps for Your Project**

- **Update BrowserbaseManager:**  
  Add explicit checks and error handling for session/page initialization before proxying.
- **Enhance Tool Wrappers:**  
  Ensure all CrewAI tools (NavigationTool, InteractionTool, etc.) validate their session/page objects before performing operations.
- **Improve Test Coverage:**  
  Simulate failed session/page initialization in unit and integration tests to ensure graceful error handling.
- **Monitor GitHub Issues:**  
  Track [browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase issues][2][4] for updates or patches related to Stagehand initialization errors.
- **Contribute Diagnostic Logs:**  
  If you encounter this error in your environment, contribute detailed logs and reproduction steps to the relevant GitHub issues to aid maintainers.

## 8. **Example: Defensive Initialization in Python**

```python
class BrowserbaseManager:
    def get_session(self):
        session = self._create_or_retrieve_session()
        if session is None or not hasattr(session, 'page'):
            raise RuntimeError("Failed to initialize browser session or page object")
        return session
```

## 9. **Summary Table: Error Handling Strategies**

| Strategy                        | Description                                           | Implementation Example                |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Initialization Checks            | Ensure objects are valid before use                   | `if not page: raise ...`              |
| Robust Session Pooling           | Exclude failed sessions from pool                     | Health checks before reuse            |
| Enhanced Logging                 | Log all initialization and proxy errors               | Use structured logs                   |
| Integration Test Simulation      | Test with mock failures                               | Simulate uninitialized sessions       |
| Vendor-Specific Safeguards       | Add extra checks for vendor tools                     | Validate session before tool actions  |

---

**In summary:**  
This Stagehand proxy initialization error is a critical, open issue in the Browserbase MCP server ecosystem[2][4]. It is most often caused by uninitialized or invalid session/page objects being proxied. To mitigate, implement robust initialization checks, error handling, and enhanced test coverage throughout your Browserbase integration and CrewAI tool wrappers. Monitor the upstream GitHub issues for patches or workarounds, and contribute diagnostic information if you encounter new variants of this error.
