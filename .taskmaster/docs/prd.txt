# Overview
Browserbase + CrewAI POC is a proof-of-concept command-line tool that combines cloud browser automation with multi-agent AI orchestration to scrape thousands of products from UK vendors simultaneously. The system starts as a CLI script for rapid development and testing, with optional web interface to be added later. It uses open-source libraries to create a scalable, distributed web scraping platform where multiple AI agents work concurrently to extract product data from various UK e-commerce sites.
